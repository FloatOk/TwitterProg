Welcome to Bot or Not!

To use this, you must have a custom token for both the OpenAI API and Scrapify for the web scraping

Put these in a .env folder in the backend of the project.

Also, install the dependancies using spm install in the frontend,
and use pip to install pytorch, asyncio, requests, and playwright
